Compilation
------------

Prerequest: The SMPlib needs to be installed.
   SMPlib is described in http://www.nas.nasa.gov/Research/
   Reports/Techreports/2003/nas-03-001-abstract.html.
   Currently the library source is only distributed within
   the NASA community.

1. copy one of the 'make.def' examples in config/NAS.samples or the
   file config/make.def.template to config/make.def

2. modify/specify the compiler and compilation flags in config/make.def

3. use the following line to compile
   make benchmark CLASS=class NPROCS=number_of_procs

   [benchmark] is one of [bt-mz, sp-mz, lu-mz]
   [class] is one of [S, W, A, B, C, D]
   [number_of_procs] is the number of SMP processes requested


Runtime Environment Variables and Setups
-----------------------------------------

1. Specify the number of threads

There are two ways to specify the number of threads:
   - using a load data file for different benchmark
      loadbt-mz.data, loadsp-mz.data, or loadlu-mz.data
   - using environment variables.

1.1 load data file


A load data file defines the number of threads used for each process
and has the following format:
   <proc#>  <number_of_threads>  <proc_group>
   <proc#>  <number_of_threads>  <proc_group>
   ...

<proc#> starts from 0, up to <number_of_procs>-1.  The <proc_group>
column can be used to specify a processor group to which a process
belongs.  This field is useful for running NPB-MZ across several
SMP boxes, where each individual SMP box could be load-balanced
with OpenMP threads up to the number of CPUs available in the box.
The file will be read by the master process from the current working 
directory.

The load data file precedes the environment variables as described in
Section 1.2, in particular, the load balancing with threads movement 
will not be applied if all values of <proc_group> are less than one.

1.2 environment variables

OMP_NUM_THREADS
  - the number of threads per process.  If this variable is not specified,
    one thread is assumed for each process.

    The total number of threads is number_of_procs * num_threads.

NPB_MZ_BLOAD
  - flag for load balancing with threads.  By default, load balancing
    with threads is on (with a value of 1, ON or TRUE).

NPB_MAX_THREADS
  - the maximum number of threads that can be used on each process for 
    load balancing.  This value is checked only if NPB_MZ_BLOAD is enabled.
    By default (with a value of 0), there is no limitation on the number
    of threads.  If NPB_MAX_THREADS is specified, the value must be either
    0 (for no limit) or no less than OMP_NUM_THREADS.

2. Other environment variables

SMP_PINIT
  - flag for enabling the thread-cpu-binding ('pin-to-node').  By default
    threads and cpus are not bound.  Specify a value of '1' to enable
    the binding.

3. Use the built-in profile timers

Creating an empty "timer.flag" file in the working directory will allow
you to collect some timing statistics of benchmarks.
